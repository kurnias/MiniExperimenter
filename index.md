## Introduction
This project aims to connect sensors and compute capability in a friendly, easy-to-explore manner for science experiments. The project can also be used to link Casio calculators and sensors, for local processing (edge compute) and for Internet of Things (IoT) experiements.
The project can use mostly off-the-shelf hardware, and only three wires need to be soldered.
